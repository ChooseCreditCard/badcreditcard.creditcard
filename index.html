    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is a “Bad Credit” Card in Documentation?</h2>
      <p>Marketing terms like “for bad credit” or “for challenged credit” are informal labels. In documentation, issuers describe these products using eligibility ranges, risk-based pricing and underwriting criteria rather than labels.</p>
      <p>Typical design goals are to provide a usable payment tool while managing higher default risk for the issuer. That balance shows up in credit limits, fees, APR ranges and how the card is reported to credit bureaus.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Mechanics -->
    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>How Cards for Challenged Credit Typically Work</h2>
      <p>While details differ, many cards aimed at bad or challenged credit share common structural features:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Lower initial credit limits</strong> – starting limits can be relatively small and may increase only after review.</li>
        <li><strong>Risk-based APR</strong> – purchase APRs are often at the higher end of the issuer’s pricing grid.</li>
        <li><strong>Fees and charges</strong> – annual fees, monthly maintenance fees or program fees may apply, depending on jurisdiction.</li>
        <li><strong>Reporting practices</strong> – many products are designed to report payment behaviour to one or more credit bureaus.</li>
        <li><strong>Account reviews</strong> – documentation may describe periodic reviews for limit increases or eligibility for other products.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some cards in this category are unsecured, while others may be partially or fully secured by a deposit, depending on the design.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Risk Controls, Fees and Behaviour Signals</h2>
      <p>Because these products target higher-risk segments, issuers use multiple controls to manage exposure:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Relatively low starting limits and caps on cash advances.</li>
        <li>Automated fraud and risk monitoring on transactions and payments.</li>
        <li>Clear late-fee and returned-payment fee structures.</li>
        <li>Potential account closure after extended delinquency or non-use.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Documentation focuses on when fees apply, how interest is calculated, and which behaviours may trigger additional reviews.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>How These Cards Interact With Credit Rebuild Efforts</h2>
      <p>From the perspective of a credit file, cards aimed at bad or challenged credit can provide new data points over time. Issuer and bureau practices vary, but documentation often notes that:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>On-time payments are typically reported as positive history.</li>
        <li>Missed or late payments may be reported as delinquencies.</li>
        <li>High utilisation (balances close to the limit) can be visible in reported data.</li>
        <li>Account closures and charge-offs are recorded according to bureau rules.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This page does not predict individual scoring outcomes; it only highlights how card usage can show up in credit-file data.</p>
