  <!-- What “bad credit” usually means -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>What “bad credit” usually means</h2>
    <p class="small">
      “Bad credit” often means more than just a low score. Issuers may see:
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>• Multiple late or missed payments</li>
      <li>• Accounts in collections</li>
      <li>• Charge-offs or defaults</li>
      <li>• Very high utilization across cards</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="small">
      That doesn’t mean you’re locked out forever. It just means you need targeted tools.
    </p>

  <!-- Best card types -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Card types that still work with bad credit</h2>
    <div class="grid">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Secured credit cards</h3>
        <p class="small">
          A cash deposit reduces issuer risk and makes approval more likely.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Credit builder cards</h3>
        <p class="small">
          Products designed for rebuilding, with clear upgrade paths if you use them well.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Subprime unsecured cards</h3>
        <p class="small">
          Higher interest, but still a line of credit if used carefully.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Store & retail cards</h3>
        <p class="small">
          Can be easier to get, but should be used sparingly and paid in full.

  <!-- Rebuild strategy -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Rebuild strategy with bad credit</h2>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>• Start with one rebuilding product, not many at once</li>
      <li>• Pay every bill on time — even one late payment slows progress</li>
      <li>• Keep usage low: under 30% of your limit, lower if possible</li>
      <li>• Avoid new non-essential debt while you repair your history</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- What to expect from issuers -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>What to expect from issuers</h2>
    <p class="small">
      With bad credit, issuers typically offer:
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>• Lower starting limits</li>
      <li>• Higher APR (interest)</li>
      <li>• Fewer perks at the beginning</li>
      <li>• Upgrade or review after 6–24 months of good behavior</li>
    </ul>
